Definition:
Recommendation about splitting interfaces into smaller interfaces.


Example:
The example is pretty straight forward in that it shows how having an interface with multiple methods can lead to our clients writing useless implementations.

Notes:
Also, as interfaces are mostly used by clients, the client might not be able to modify the inerface provided.
