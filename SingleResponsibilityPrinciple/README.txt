Single Responsibility Principle

Definition:
Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software and that functionality
would be encapsulated by that class/module.

Example:
1. Journal has the responsibility of maintaining addition and removal of entries to the journal
2. Persistence takes care of persisting the journal to various possible locations


Notes:
SRP also helps in Separation of Concerns
