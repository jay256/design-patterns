Definition:
A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y


Examples:
LineToPointAdapter acts as an adapter which converts our Line interface to Point interface.

1. While implementing Adpaters, extra objects might be created. Caching is used to prevent extra object creation
