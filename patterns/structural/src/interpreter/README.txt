Definition:
A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turing it into separate lexical tokens(lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens(parsing).

Examples:
- Textual inputs need to be processed.
    - eg. turned into OOP structures
- Programming language compilers, interpreters, IDEs
- HTML, XML, Numerical expressions, Regular expressions

Notes:
- Turning strings into OOP based structures in a complicated process
- Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts in two stages
    - Lexing turns text into a set of tokens
    - Parsing turns tokens into meaningful constructs
    - Parsed data can then be evaluated
